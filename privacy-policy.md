TipWise ("the App") is developed with your privacy as a top priority. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our tip calculator application.

**The short version:** We don't collect any data. Period.

## Information We Collect

**None.**

TipWise does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or usage data. The App operates entirely on your device with no connection to external servers.

## How the App Works

TipWise is designed to function 100% offline:

- All calculations are performed locally on your device
- No data is sent over the internet
- No information is stored after you close the App
- No account or sign-in is required
- No cookies or tracking technologies are used

## Data Storage

TipWise does not store any data. When you close the App:

- Your bill amount is not saved
- Your service selections are not saved
- Your tip calculations are not saved

---

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever update this privacy policy, we will:

- Update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page
- Post the revised policy at this same location

Since TipWise does not collect data, significant changes to this policy are unlikely.

You have complete privacy by default.
